# Changelog

All notable changes to the packages in this monorepo are documented in this file,
as a single timeline (most recent first). The repository hosts four independently
versioned packages — **GNNGraphs.jl**, **GNNlib.jl**, **GraphNeuralNetworks.jl**
(Flux frontend), and **GNNLux.jl** (Lux frontend) — and each release below is
tagged with the package it belongs to.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the packages adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Entries link to the pull request that introduced them.

## GNNGraphs.jl — Unreleased (towards 1.6.0)

**Added**
- Added a `Mooncake` package extension, so that Mooncake can differentiate on CUDA through `add_self_loops` and through adjacency-matrix graphs. Float edge weights of adjacency-matrix graphs stay differentiable ([#704]).

**Fixed**
- Added an `EnzymeCore` package extension marking `scaled_laplacian` inactive for Enzyme, matching its existing `@non_differentiable` ChainRules declaration. Enzyme previously differentiated the Krylov eigensolve inside it and failed; this unblocks `ChebConv`, `GConvGRUCell` and `GConvLSTMCell` ([#706]).
- Enzyme can now differentiate through the adjacency-matrix → COO graph conversion: a new internal keyword-free helper `_to_coo_graph` avoids the union-typed keyword handling of the `GNNGraph(g; graph_type)` constructor and of `to_coo`, which Enzyme's type analysis cannot compile. Together with upstream fixes in Enzyme ≥ 0.13.197 this removes the `EnzymeInternalError` crash on `:dense`/`:sparse` graphs ([#703]).

## GNNLux.jl — Unreleased (towards 0.2.0)

**Added**
- Added pooling layers (`GlobalPool`, `GlobalAttentionPool`, `TopKPool`) ([#576]).
- `TGCN` now supports non-linear activation functions ([#596]).
- Rewrote the recurrent temporal layers following the Flux frontend's design ([#560]): added the `GNNRecurrence` wrapper and split every temporal layer into a `*Cell` and a full-sequence layer, exporting both — `TGCNCell`/`TGCN`, `GConvGRUCell`/`GConvGRU`, `GConvLSTMCell`/`GConvLSTM`, `DCGRUCell`/`DCGRU`, `EvolveGCNOCell`/`EvolveGCNO`. A layer now consumes a whole sequence at once (an `in × timesteps × num_nodes` array on a `GNNGraph`, or a vector of snapshots on a `TemporalSnapshotsGNNGraph`) and returns the full output sequence ([#696]).

**Changed**
- Bumped the NNlib, OneHotArrays, StableRNGs, and DocumenterInterLinks compat bounds ([#687], [#686], [#684], [#685]).
- The temporal cells now share their forward-pass math with the Flux frontend via new `GNNlib` functions, and several formulas were corrected in the process (e.g. the `GConvGRU` candidate state, previously `tanh` of the wrong term, and the `GConvLSTM` peephole connections) ([#696]).

**Removed**
- Removed the `A3TGCN` layer, mirroring its removal from the Flux frontend ([#696]).

## GNNlib.jl — Unreleased (towards 1.4.1)

**Fixed**
- Fixed `Enzyme.gradient` failing when differentiating `GCNConv`, `SGConv` and `TAGConv` on `:dense`/`:sparse` adjacency graphs: their adjacency-matrix fallbacks now convert via the Enzyme-differentiable `GNNGraphs._to_coo_graph` instead of the keyword `GNNGraph` constructor. Requires GNNGraphs ≥ 1.5.2 and, for Enzyme, Enzyme ≥ 0.13.197 ([#703]).

## GraphNeuralNetworks.jl — Unreleased (towards 1.1.1)

**Changed**
- `GNNRecurrence` now hands each cell an indexed time slice instead of an `eachslice` view, matching the Lux frontend. Enzyme's type analysis fails on `SubArray` cell inputs, so this unblocks `DCGRU`, `EvolveGCNO`, `GConvGRU` and `GConvLSTM` under Enzyme ([#707]).
- The recurrent temporal cells now delegate their forward-pass math to shared `GNNlib` functions (requires GNNlib ≥ 1.4); the layer behaviour is unchanged ([#696]).

## GNNlib.jl 1.4.0 — 2026-07-22

**Added**
- Added framework-agnostic forward passes for the recurrent temporal cells — `tgcn`, `gconv_gru`, `gconv_lstm`, `dcgru` — shared by the Flux and Lux frontends ([#696]).

**Fixed**
- Worked around a Julia 1.12 code-generation segfault that crashed `CGConv` and `GMMConv` gradients: the layers' `@warn` (in the residual branch) is now wrapped in `ignore_derivatives` to keep the logging macro out of the AD-differentiated code path. Root cause reported upstream as [FluxML/Zygote.jl#1662]; re-enables the previously disabled `CGConv`/`GMMConv` gradient tests ([#695]).

## GNNGraphs.jl 1.5.1 — 2026-07-22

**Changed**
- Relaxed the `CUDA` compat bound to `"5, 6"`, adding support for CUDA.jl v6 ([#690]).
- Bumped the NNlib and KrylovKit compat bounds ([#687], [#680]).

**Fixed**
- Fixed `remove_edges` triggering scalar indexing on GPU graphs ([#672], [#691]).
- Fixed `getgraph` failing on GPU graphs ([#691]).
- Fixed `remove_self_loops` mutating the input for adjacency-matrix graphs ([#659]).
- Fixed `unbatch` for COO batches containing zero-edge graphs ([#652]).
- Fixed `sample_nbrs` when sampling without replacement ([#648]).

## GNNlib.jl 1.3.0 — 2026-07-22

**Added**
- Added Mooncake rules for the `propagate` `copy_xj`, `e_mul_xj`, and `w_mul_xj` fast paths ([#677], [#678], [#679]).

**Changed**
- Relaxed the `CUDA` compat bound to `"5, 6"`, adding support for CUDA.jl v6 ([#690]).
- Bumped the NNlib compat bound ([#687]).

**Fixed**
- Fixed the `d_conv` (`DConv`) forward pass, which did not compute the diffusion convolution from the paper: the degree normalization was inverted (multiplying by degree instead of `D_O⁻¹`/`D_I⁻¹`), one weight slice was applied twice, and a spurious Chebyshev `2T − T₀` recurrence was used in place of the paper's bidirectional random-walk power series. Isolated nodes are now handled without producing `NaN` ([#592]).

## GNNlib.jl 1.2.1 — 2026-04-29

**Changed**
- Bumped the DataStructures compat bound ([#670]).

**Fixed**
- Fixed the `gmm_conv` (`GMMConv`) implementation ([#645]).

## GNNlib.jl 1.2.0 — 2026-01-11

**Added**
- Added support for reducing nodes over heterogeneous graphs ([#634]).

**Fixed**
- Fixed empty-edge handling in `softmax_edge_neighbors` ([#636]).

## GNNGraphs.jl 1.5.0 — 2025-12-24

**Added**
- Added `coalesce` and `is_coalesced` to sort and merge duplicate edges of COO graphs, and to query coalesced state ([#613], [#624], [#625]).
- Added SpMM-based message passing with CUDA support for coalesced COO graphs ([#617]).
- Added a `fmt` keyword to `adjacency_matrix` to select the output format, plus a `copy_xj` `propagate` fast path for Metal ([#619]).
- Added CUDA support for the `binarize()` operation on sparse matrices ([#601]).

**Changed**
- The monorepo now uses Julia workspaces for development ([#630]).

**Fixed**
- Fixed the NNlib CUDA extension ([#621]).

## GNNlib.jl 1.1.0 — 2025-12-24

**Added**
- Added SpMM-based message passing with CUDA support for coalesced COO graphs ([#617]).
- Added CUDA sparse support for the `propagate` `copy_xj` and `w_mul_xj` fast paths via matrix multiplication ([#605], [#610]).
- Added a `fmt` keyword to `adjacency_matrix` and a `copy_xj` `propagate` fast path for Metal ([#619]).

**Changed**
- Refactored `propagate` signatures to accept COO subtypes for the `copy_xj` and `w_mul_xj` fast paths ([#611]).

**Fixed**
- Fixed the NNlib CUDA extension ([#621]).

`ResGatedGraphConv`, and the temporal layers `TGCN`, `GConvGRU`, `GConvLSTM`,
`DCGRU`, `EvolveGCNO`) that share the message-passing implementations in GNNlib.
